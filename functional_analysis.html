            <h2> Abstract </h2>
                Functional Analysis is the branch of mathematics
                which studies infinite dimensional vector spaces. This 
                field have important results which affects other branchs
                such as Signal Processing, Control Theory, Partial 
                Differential Equations, Quantum Mechanics and the list 
                goes on...

            In Linear Algebra we study several types of <em>Vector Spaces</em>,
            but we are focus only in the finite dimensional case. We may see
            during a good Linear Algebra course some examples of Infinite dimensional
            spaces, but they are not really the main object of study.
        </p>
        <p>
            The differences from the finite dimensional to infinite dimensional
            are quite significant and that is the reason it is separated in two
            different courses. We will see that many results that holds in both
            finite dimensional and infinite dimensional cases, but there are 
            crucial results that differs and we may see the consequences from
            those differences.

            We start the theory recalling the definition of <em>Vector Spaces</em>:
            <div class="definition">
                A vector space is a non-empty set $V$ endowed with two operations
                $ +: V \times V \to V $ and $ \cdot: \mathbb{F} \times V \to V $,
                satisfying the following axioms:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        $ +: V \times V \to V $ is commutative, that is, for 
                        $u,v \in V$, $u + v = v + u$.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </div>
        </p>
