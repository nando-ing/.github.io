In the engineering courses, this subjects have an amount of mathematical
techniques to deal with functions and function transformations.

In a formal point of view, this would be covered by Functional Analysis, 
Fourier Analysis and Distribution theory.

The goal of this note is to formalize the Signals & Systems concepts and 
illustrate it with several examples and applications.
