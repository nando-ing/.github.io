# Why study Bayasian Statistics?

There are two main interpretations for probability the one, we call _Frequentist_
and the other we call _Bayesianist_. The _frequentists_ believes that the probability
comes from a random experiment, while the bayesianist believes that the probability
also can stand for a measure of belief. This discussion for which interpretation
should we use was there for a while until the work of R. T. Cox.

In 1946, R. T. Cox tried to find axioms to what we call Plausible Reasoning.
The idea was to formalize how we reason with an incomplete set of information,
affecting to each assertion a degree of belief according to some prior knowledge.

With the axioms Cox proposed, we can derive the Kolmogorov axioms for probability
which was the base for the _frequentist_ interpretation of probability. From
this result we can interpret the _Bayesian_ approach as a generalisation from
the _frequentist_ one.

R. T. Cox did not stop there. He showed that with his set of axioms there is 
only one measure we can use to measure the degrees of belief, which is the one
that coincides with the classical probability measure and if we choose another
measure, we would have a system that is inconsistent.
